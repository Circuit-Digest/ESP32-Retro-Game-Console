Do you remember the old classic 8bit games? Perhaps you enjoyed your leisure time in front of an early home computer or video game system.  They were so nostalgic and every kid in that era loved them. Now they are replaced with modern high-end graphics and game dynamics. Yet many people still love to play those classic games. Nowadays the only way to play these games is through emulators. So, in this tutorial, we are looking at how to make such a device that can emulate those classic games. This console is based on the popular Odroid Go, with updated firmware and new IPS display. And the firmware used is a modified version of ducalex's retro-go firmware.
